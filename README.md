# Getting Started with Dao React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

Overview
This React project aims to revolutionize STEM education by providing a platform for teachers to create bite-sized lessons tailored to individual student needs. This approach offers a more personalized and engaging learning experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Key Features

* User Authentication: Allows teachers to create accounts and manage their lessons.
* Lesson Creation: A user-friendly interface for creating bite-sized lessons, including text, images, and videos.
* Lesson Organization: Teachers can organize lessons into units or topics.
* Student Progress Tracking: Tracks student progress through lessons and provides personalized recommendations.
* Interactive Elements: Includes quizzes, coding challenges, and simulations to enhance learning.

### Future Enhancements:
